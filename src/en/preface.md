# Preface

Although the concept of "natural capital" was formally introduced in the development of modern economics and ecology, human practices in managing natural capital can be traced back to ancient times, tens of thousands of years ago. Early humans, through their interactions with the natural environment, gradually accumulated knowledge and management experience of natural resources, which laid the foundation for their survival and development.
Firstly, in primitive societies, humans consciously began to manage natural resources to meet their basic survival needs. They obtained food through hunting, gathering, and fishing activities but also understood the importance of avoiding over-exploitation of a particular area. For example, they followed seasonal migration patterns to allow plant and animal resources sufficient time to recover. This sustainable use of resources reflects an early, rudimentary management of natural capital.
Secondly, the advent of agriculture marked the beginning of systematic management of land and water resources by humans. Ancient civilizations, such as Mesopotamia in the Tigris-Euphrates river system, Egypt in the Nile River valley, and China in the Yellow River basin, developed irrigation techniques, crop rotation systems, and soil improvement methods. These practices not only increased land productivity but also demonstrated a profound understanding and effective management of natural capital.
Moreover, many ancient cultures and religious beliefs included reverence and protection for nature. For instance, some indigenous cultures regarded specific forests, rivers, or mountains as sacred places, prohibiting logging or hunting. These traditions objectively protected the ecological environment and represented another form of natural capital management.
Traditional fisheries and forestry management also reflected early human emphasis on natural capital. By establishing fishing seasons, limiting fishing tools, and setting up protected areas, people attempted to maintain the renewability of resources and ensure long-term benefits.
Thus, it can be seen that although "natural capital" as a concept is a product of modern society, the practice of managing natural capital has been interwoven throughout the history of human civilization. Early humans, through experience and wisdom, established a harmonious relationship with nature, providing valuable insights for our current sustainable development.
Examples such as Yu the Great's flood control, the construction of the Dujiangyan irrigation system, and the management of the Euphrates River illustrate not only the utilization of natural resources by humans but also reflect an early profound understanding and effective management of natural capital.
The legend of Yu the Great's flood control originates from ancient China. According to records, Yu spent 13 years traveling across the country to manage frequent floods. Instead of using simple blocking methods, he chose to divert the water, channeling floods into rivers and the sea. This strategy not only reduced the damage of floods to farmland and residents but also improved soil fertility. Yu's flood control practices demonstrated comprehensive water resource management, recognizing that floods were both a threat and a resource, effectively distributing and utilizing water resources through reasonable diversion. This process showcased early human respect for natural laws and wise management of natural capital.
The construction of the Dujiangyan irrigation system is another vivid example. In 256 BC, Li Bing and his son built this magnificent water conservancy project on the Min River in Sichuan. The Dujiangyan system, composed of the Fish Mouth Levee, Flying Sand Weir, and Bottle-Neck Channel, is unique in its design as it does not use a dam but instead utilizes the natural flow of water to achieve flood diversion, irrigation, and navigation. This method avoided damage to the river's ecology and maintained the sustainable use of water resources. The completion of Dujiangyan not only increased the agricultural productivity of the Chengdu Plain but also protected the surrounding ecological environment. Its functions in soil and water conservation and flood control reflect long-term management and investment in natural capital.
In ancient Mesopotamia, the management of the Euphrates River similarly demonstrated early natural capital management. As early as 4000 BC, residents began managing and utilizing the river. They built complex irrigation canal systems to divert river water into fields, significantly increasing agricultural output and supporting the rise of cities and the development of civilization. Additionally, they learned to manage seasonal floods by controlling water flow with dikes and channels to prevent flood disasters. This practice not only protected farmland but also utilized the fertile sediments brought by floods, enhancing land productivity. Notably, ancient laws such as the Code of Hammurabi included provisions on water resource management, stipulating water rights and irrigation obligations, reflecting institutionalized management of natural capital.
These historical examples show that humans began managing natural capital thousands of years ago. Through wisdom and practice, they utilized natural resources to improve their lives while also focusing on protection and sustainable use. These ancient natural capital management practices provide us with valuable experiences and insights. They emphasize harmonious coexistence with nature and respect for natural laws, aligning with modern sustainable development concepts. Understanding and learning from these historical experiences can help us better address current environmental challenges. While promoting economic development, we should focus on protecting and rationally utilizing natural capital to achieve symbiosis and mutual prosperity between humans and nature.
Yu the Great's flood control, the construction of the Dujiangyan irrigation system, and the management of the Euphrates River are vivid examples of early human natural capital management. These practices not only advanced the progress of society at the time but also left valuable wisdom for future generations, fully proving that although "natural capital" as a concept is modern, its management practices have been interwoven throughout the history of human civilization.
Contemporary China has achieved significant theoretical innovations and practical results in leading ecological civilization construction. As a new form of civilization, ecological civilization has become an important part of China's national development strategy. China not only actively promotes ecological civilization construction domestically but also advocates for green development concepts internationally, contributing Chinese wisdom and solutions to global sustainable development.
Firstly, from a theoretical perspective, the development of the ecological civilization concept in China has undergone a process from proposal to deepening. As early as 2007, the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China first proposed the concept of "ecological civilization," emphasizing the need to build a resource-saving and environmentally friendly society. Since then, the concept of ecological civilization has been continuously enriched and improved. In 2012, the 18th National Congress incorporated ecological civilization construction into the "five-in-one" overall layout of socialism with Chinese characteristics, alongside economic, political, cultural, and social construction. General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasized that "lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets," a scientific assertion that profoundly reveals the dialectical relationship between economic development and ecological protection, becoming an important theoretical basis for guiding China's ecological civilization construction.
Secondly, at the policy level, China has introduced a series of laws, regulations, and policy documents to build a comprehensive ecological civilization system. In 2015, the "Overall Plan for the Reform of the Ecological Civilization System" was released, clarifying the overall goals and main tasks of ecological civilization system reform. Subsequently, laws such as the "Environmental Protection Law," "Water Pollution Prevention and Control Law," and "Soil Pollution Prevention and Control Law" were revised or introduced, providing legal guarantees for ecological and environmental protection. Meanwhile, China has also established systems for ecological environment damage compensation, ecological red lines, and green development evaluation and assessment, strengthening the institutional constraints of ecological civilization construction.
Thirdly, in practice, China actively promotes green development, achieving significant environmental improvements and economic transformation results. Firstly, there is the optimization of the energy structure. China vigorously develops renewable energy, becoming the world's largest producer and consumer of renewable energy. The installed capacity and power generation of clean energy such as wind, solar, and biomass energy continue to grow. Secondly, pollution control has been deeply advanced. China has implemented action plans for pollution prevention and control, such as the "Air Ten," "Water Ten," and "Soil Ten," improving air quality, water environment quality, and soil environment quality. Thirdly, ecological restoration and protection have been strengthened. China has promoted large-scale land greening actions, implemented ecological projects such as natural forest protection and returning farmland to forests and grasslands, continuously increasing forest coverage and gradually restoring ecosystem functions.
In addition, China emphasizes innovation-driven and technological support in ecological civilization construction. By promoting green technology innovation and industrial upgrading, emerging green industries have been cultivated. Fields such as new energy vehicles, green buildings, and energy-saving and environmental protection equipment have developed rapidly, injecting new momentum into economic growth. At the same time, China actively explores new models such as smart environmental protection and digital ecology, improving the efficiency and level of ecological environment governance.
In terms of international cooperation, China actively participates in global environmental governance, advocating for the establishment of a fair, reasonable, and win-win global environmental governance system. China has proposed the "Belt and Road" green development initiative, promoting green infrastructure construction, green energy cooperation, and green finance development. China also actively participates in international cooperation to address climate change, committing to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and striving to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. These initiatives reflect China's responsibility as a major power, contributing to global ecological civilization construction.
However, China's ecological civilization construction also faces challenges. On the one hand, the contradiction between economic development and resource environment remains prominent, and environmental pollution and ecological damage issues in some areas have not been fundamentally resolved. On the other hand, the concept of ecological civilization needs to be deeply ingrained in people's hearts, and a green lifestyle and consumption pattern have not yet been fully formed. Therefore, in the future ecological civilization construction, China needs to further deepen reforms, improve systems, strengthen technological support, and enhance public ecological awareness.
In summary, contemporary China has achieved important theoretical innovations and practical results in leading ecological civilization construction. By incorporating ecological civilization construction into the national development strategy, building a comprehensive system, promoting green development and ecological restoration, China has set an example for global sustainable development. In the future, China will continue to adhere to ecological priority and green development, striving to achieve harmonious coexistence between humans and nature, making new and greater contributions to building a beautiful China and a beautiful world.
The history of human civilization can be interpreted from multiple perspectives, and improving the technology for managing natural capital is undoubtedly one of the most important dimensions. This process has run through the entire evolutionary history of human civilization, from the earliest hunter-gatherer societies to today's high-tech era, humans have always been exploring and improving methods and means of utilizing natural resources. This continuous improvement in natural capital management technology has not only driven the development of social productivity but also profoundly influenced the structure and culture of human society.
In the early days, humans relied on simple tools and primitive techniques to obtain food and resources. The crafting of stone tools, the use of fire, and simple hunting and gathering methods were the initial human technologies. The emergence and improvement of these technologies enabled humans to utilize natural resources more effectively, gradually shifting from passive adaptation to the environment to actively transforming it.
With the advent of the agricultural revolution, humans began to settle, domesticate plants and animals, and develop agricultural technologies such as farming and irrigation. These technological advances greatly increased food production, supporting population growth and social complexity. Improvements in farming techniques, such as crop rotation, fallowing, and fertilization, not only increased land productivity but also reflected a deep understanding of natural laws.
During the industrial revolution, the invention of the steam engine and the widespread adoption of mechanized production brought human utilization of natural capital into a new phase. Large-scale resource extraction, efficient energy use, and rapid development of transportation and communication technologies greatly enhanced social productivity. However, this period of excessive exploitation and utilization of natural capital also led to environmental pollution and ecological destruction.
In contemporary times, the development of high technology provides more advanced means for managing natural capital. Breakthroughs in information technology, biotechnology, and new energy technologies allow us to monitor and utilize natural resources more precisely. For example, through remote sensing technology and geographic information systems, we can monitor forest coverage and marine biological resources in real-time; through genetic engineering, we can cultivate high-yield, disease-resistant crops; through the application of new energy technologies, we reduce reliance on fossil fuels and lower environmental pollution.
However, despite the significant role of technology in managing natural capital, human understanding of nature still has limitations. The complexity and diversity of natural systems mean that in the process of using technology to transform nature, we often overlook some potential risks and consequences. For example, the widespread use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers, while increasing agricultural yields in the short term, has led to soil degradation, water pollution, and loss of biodiversity in the long term. The discharge of industrial waste gases and wastewater has caused severe air and water pollution, affecting human health and living environments.
This limitation in understanding nature requires us to not only rely on technology but also on art in managing natural capital. Here, "art" does not refer to narrow artistic creation but to a concept and value system, as well as a way of thinking about complex problems. For example, how to view the relationship between humans and animals, how to achieve symbiosis between humans and nature, these issues go beyond purely technical domains and require artistic thinking to understand and solve.
Artistic thinking emphasizes wholeness, creativity, and emotional resonance, helping us to more comprehensively understand nature and the relationship between humans and nature. It reminds us not to view nature merely as a resource and tool but to respect its intrinsic value and acknowledge the life rights and existence value of all natural entities. This value system encourages us to be more cautious and responsible in utilizing natural resources, pursuing sustainable development models.
For example, many indigenous cultures have a sense of reverence and awe for nature. They believe that all natural entities have spirituality and that humans and nature are interdependent. This belief leads them to follow natural rhythms in hunting, gathering, and farming, avoiding over-exploitation and waste. This is a form of natural capital management based on artistic thinking, reflecting harmonious coexistence between humans and nature.
In modern society, the rise of ecological ethics also reflects the role of art in natural capital management. Ecological ethics advocates that humans should bear moral responsibility for the natural environment and other living beings, not just for their own interests. This concept encourages us to rethink traditional development models, advocating for green economy, circular economy, and other new economic models, pursuing a win-win situation for economic and ecological benefits.
Furthermore, art enhances people's perception and recognition of nature through aesthetic experiences. Literature, music, painting, and other art forms can inspire people's love and protection of nature. For example, nature literature depicts beautiful natural landscapes and vivid wildlife images, evoking readers' longing for and cherishing of nature. Environmental art, through the clever use of natural elements, creates breathtaking artworks, raising public awareness of environmental protection.
When addressing complex environmental issues, the creativity and flexibility of artistic thinking also play a crucial role. Facing severe challenges such as global climate change and biodiversity loss, we need to go beyond traditional technical means and seek innovative solutions. For example, the planning and design of ecological cities integrate knowledge from ecology, architecture, sociology, and other disciplines, emphasizing the harmonious unity of the natural environment and human living environment. Such practices reflect the integration of technology and art, providing new paths for sustainable development.
In conclusion, improving the technology for managing natural capital is a significant driving force for the development of human civilization, but technology alone is not enough. Due to our limited understanding of nature, managing natural capital requires guidance and supplementation from artistic concepts and values. Artistic thinking helps us view nature from a more macro and humanistic perspective, understanding the deep relationship between humans and nature, thereby formulating more scientific and reasonable resource management strategies.
In the future, we need to promote the integration of technology and art in education, culture, policy, and other aspects. In education, we should cultivate students' scientific and humanistic literacy, encouraging them to master advanced technology while having ecological awareness and social responsibility. In culture, we should support the development of environmental art, ecological literature, and other fields, using the power of art to spread the concept of ecological civilization. In policy, we should formulate and implement laws and regulations conducive to sustainable development, encouraging innovation and practice, providing institutional guarantees for the integration of technology and art.
Only in this way can we truly achieve effective management of natural capital, promoting human civilization towards a more harmonious and sustainable direction. This not only concerns the well-being of contemporary humans but also affects the survival and development of future generations, a noble cause that requires the joint efforts of all humanity.
